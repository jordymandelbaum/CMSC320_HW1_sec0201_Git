Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: You can switch branches in Git so that you test things out. If one thing doesn't work and it has a risk of messing up a lot of your project, then it is a safe way to experiment.
Also, it is good for collaboration. 

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Answer: Data science could be applied to finance as a field. In the field of finance, you deal with a lot of large datasets and huge tables of data, such as income sheets. Data science could be applied here to 
clean up the data, interperet it, and make it easier to use for the client. For example, in a consulting job, you may be looking at a company's balance sheet. You could use data science to provide simple
reasons why that company is losing money based off the balance sheet. 

Q3: What is the difference between Merging and Rebasing?

Answer: Merging is taking a branch and combining it with the main branch. It takes the changes you made and adds them to the main branch version. Rebasing on the other hand is when you combine the two branches,
the rebased branch overwrites the main branch. Instead of having to make sure that they do not conflict, the rebasing overwrites the previous history.
