Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Answer: Data science could be applied to finance as a field. In the field of finance, you deal with a lot of large datasets and huge tables of data, such as income sheets. Data science could be applied here to 
clean up the data, interperet it, and make it easier to use for the client. For example, in a consulting job, you may be looking at a company's balance sheet. You could use data science to provide simple
reasons why that company is losing money based off the balance sheet.
